            <li>The Mass-Energy Equivalence, which states that mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other.</li>
            <li>The Special Theory of Relativity, which describes how space and time are relative to the observer and the speed of light is constant.</li>
            <li>The General Theory of Relativity, which extends the Special Theory of Relativity to include gravity and curved space-time.</li>
            <li>The Photoelectric Effect, which explains how light can eject electrons from a metal surface.</li>
            <li>The Quantum Theory of Light, which proposes that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons.</li>
